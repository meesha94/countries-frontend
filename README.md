# CountriesGame Frontend

This is the front end repo for a simple quiz game using React. A random country will be displayed and there are 3 answer options for you to pick from. Click on the capital of the country given that you think is the right answer, and it will then tell you if you are correct or not. You also have the option to exit the game.

## Accessing the Game

You can access the game by running the frontend server and navigating to:
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Enjoy playing the game!

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the frontend, ensure that you have the backend server running. Follow these steps to set up the backend:

1. **Clone the backend repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/meesha94/CountiresGame.git
    cd CountiresGame
    ```

2. **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the backend server:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:8000` by default.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Cloning and Running the Frontend

1. **Clone the frontend repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/meesha94/countries-frontend.git
    ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the frontend server:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
